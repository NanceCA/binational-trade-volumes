          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p class="lead">International commerce can generate a variety of favorable social, economic, and political
            externalities. In addition to mutual economic gain, trade can also encourage a strengthened social and
            political
            bilateral relationship between trading
            partners. </p>
          <p class="font-weight-normal">Recognizing that international trade can often also trigger unfavorable
            circumstances, this study
            will focus on better understanding and optimizing the favorable components of a binational commerce
            relationship. This moves forward under the assumption that the broader economic system will continue to be
            globalized
            and so finding ways to optimize the positive externalities is a worthwhile effort for improved political,
            social and
            economic dynamics around the world. <br><br>
            Mexico and the United States make ideal selections for this study given
            the intricate historical trade relationship and the interwoven dynamic in the areas of culture, business and
            politics. For comparative purposes, trade and mobility data is included for the US-Canadian relationship.
            <br><br>

            This capstone project aims to answer the following key questions through exploratory data analysis, data
            preprocessing and regression.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> What are we trying to understand?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trade volumes are often a way to quantify a bilateral relationship. If mobility between countries can be
              a
              catalyst for a strengthed bilateral relationship (and trade volumes an indicator of an existing
              relationship), can key datapoints around trade volumes provide any
              insight into mobility trends? In other words, is there a relationship between mobility data and binational
              trade data? </li>
            <li>Can insights in trade and mobility trends support the institutions that facilitate efficiency in both
              areas? Let's take California ports of entry as a use case. </li>
            <li> How can better understanding
              the nuances in the trade data (aggregate import and export volumes) and mobility data provide greater
              insight into the results of binational commerce?
            </li>
            <li>Can binational travel, that may or may not come as a requirement of binational transactions,
              also be an indictator strengthened cultural mutual understanding?</li>
          </ul>

              <p class="card-text">The boolean value represents whether or not a mobility observance happened to be
                through a California port of entry. Running a Naive Bayes model including the Port Code and Mobility
                enables us to predict which port codes may experience higher travel transactions (commercial and
                non-commercial) as mobility rises. Equipped with this information ports of entry can cater to the final
                user and dedicate resources to design for efficiencies. </p>

          <p> Additional Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models were conducted to predict the specific measure (or
            means of transportation) for binational mobility. This included commercial and non-commercial measures. The
            top measures were Pedestrian travel and Commercial Truck travel. The model visualizations can be found on
            the Jupyter Notebook. No significant trends were identified to pursue insights on a specific port code. More
            granularity on each of the measures is needed.

            relationship among countries in close proximity.</p><br>

              Q: Is there a relationship between mobility data and binational
              trade data? <br><br> A: The polynomial regression suggests that a relationship exists. Given
              the polynomial
              regression, it is clear that other factors (many of them may be social and political) influence mobility
              aside from just trade volumes. An interesting comparison emerges when taking a look at the US-Canadian
              trade data which shows 1) similar trade data trends compared to that of
              US-MX but 2) the mobility patterns are more consistent. This may further showcase how other factors
              influence (inhibit or enable) mobility as well.

              Q: Can insights in trade and mobility trends support the institutions that facilitate efficiency in both
              areas?<br><br> A: Yes! The Naive Bayes model reveals how likely it is that mobility is focused in
              California ports of entry according to select features. Chambers of Commerce, local and federal
              government, as well as private sector actors that depend on trade can leverage these data points to cater
              efficiency and an improved user experience to busy port of entries in California.

              the nuances in the trade data (aggregate import and export volumes) and mobility data provide greater
              insight into the results of binational commerce? <br><br>
              A: More data about the influence of mobility may be necessary to best answer the question above. However,
              using the information and regression models here, the inflection point in the polynomial regression by
              export/import
              model may provide further input into the result of binational commerce. Furthermore, the simple linear
              regression further suggests that import and export volumes are closely related and positively inclined,
              further linking both economies.

                requirement of binational transactions,
                also be an indictator strengthened cultural mutual understanding?<br><br>
                A: To best answer this question, binational or perspective/sentiment surveys should be correlated
                with
                the
                period after the inflection point in mobility.</p>
